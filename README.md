# Image Preprocessing
In this project, I evaluated how different image preprocessing methods affected the accuracy of the tesseract OCR algorithm. I compared inverted binary thesholding to the otsu algorithm, I compared blurring the image vs no blur, and I compared 3 iterations of dilation vs 1 iteration.
